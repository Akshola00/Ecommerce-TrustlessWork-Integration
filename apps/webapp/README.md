## üèó Architecture

The web application follows a structured component-based approach:

- **Layout Components**: Base layout structure (`components/layout/`)
- **Shared Components**: Reusable UI elements (`components/shared/`)
- **Section Components**: Page-specific sections (`components/sections/`)
- **UI Components**: Basic UI building blocks (`components/ui/`)
- **TrustlessWork Components**: Integration components for escrow services (`components/trustlesswork/`)

### Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
